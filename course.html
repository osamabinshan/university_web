        <h3>Intermediate</h3>
        <p>There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text.</p>

    <div class="course-col">
        <h3>Degree</h3>
        <p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English.</p>
</div>
<div class="course-col">
<h3>Post-Graduation</h3>
<p>The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.</p>

    <h3>World Class Library</h3>
    <p>Globalization of higher education has increased the number of
        international students in the United States. Besides college-age students, midcareer professionals also come to this country for short-term programs to
        enhance their knowledge. Globalization also creates a diversity of academic staff
        and faculty in higher education institutions.</p>

        <p>The playground is located about a kilometer from our school. So the students have the opportunity of walking to the playground. As all games are played in the evening the students find it pleasant to go to the ground and play.</p>
