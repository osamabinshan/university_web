            <h2>Our Certificate & Online Programs For 2022</h2>
            <p>Create a foundation for your art to take flight with a certificate from Full Sail University. Our art and design certificates help you hone in on your unique style while learning the essential skills you need to succeed in the industry. Develop your personal brand and learn from up-to-date, experienced creatives in the art and design world.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The Visual Design undergraduate certificate program provides students with an introduction to the language of design and the theories that ground the production of quality visual products. Students will gain experience with the tools used in design projects as well as recognize the professional workflow that is adapted to develop creative ideas.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Online courses are conducted through the Canvas learning management system (LMS), which is part of the Learn@UW suite of learning technologies. They often consist of modules that divide the course material into easy-to-digest portions. An eight-week course might be split into four modules lasting two weeks apiece, or eight modules covering different topics. Instructors provide a syllabus listing important assignments, deadlines, virtual office hours and a weekly flow diagram (also known as a weekly rhythm) that illustrates how to structure your week to succeed in the course.</p>
            <br>
            <p>This summer, experience UW–Madison academics from anywhere in the world. Taught by prestigious instructors from the university’s face-to-face courses, online Summer Term courses are a convenient way to make progress toward your degree and lighten your load for a future semester. They also pair well with a summer job or internship.</p>
